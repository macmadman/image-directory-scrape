Image Scraper Bookmarklet
===================================

A bookmarket for scraping images from a webpage that share the same directory.

Useful for image-rich sites that store similar images in the same directory, 
allowing you to scrape only the images you want and not the junk.

** This bookmarklet has been developed for and tested with Chrome, I have yet to try it out in 
** other browsers
